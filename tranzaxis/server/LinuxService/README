This instruction assumes that there is a base direcotry somewhere on server machine for config files/scripts/etc, and that two files are available:

 - instanceN_daemon_template - this is a template for deamon script which should be placed to /etc/init.d folder. There should be separate daemon script for each instance. For example, for Instance #1 - /etc/init.d/instance1, for Instance #5 - /etc/init.d/instance5. 
 - runInstance - this is a helper script which will be used by all daemon scripts to actually run particular instance

Steps:

1) put runInstance to base directory

2) ensure that runInstance is executable and accessible for appropriate OS user,
this can be done by the following commands: "chown <user> <base directory>/runInstance" and "chmod +x <base directory>/runInstance"

After that for each instance (assuming instance id is N):

1) put instance #N configuration file to <base directory>/instanceN.cfg 
(here and below N should be replaced with actual instance id, for example, instance1.cfg)

2) create service launcher script in /etc/init.d as a copy of instanceN_daemon_template. Choose appropriate name for service script, such as instanceN

3) fill configuration variables at the top of the created service launcher script

4) Ensure that service launcher script is executable. Service launcher script should be runned with sudo privileges.

7) if the system is redhat, run "sudo chkconfig --add instanceN"
   if the system is ubuntu, run "sudo update-rc.d instanceN defaults 95"

8) Check service work: 
    sudo /etc/init.d/instanceN start
    sudo /etc/init.d/instanceN status
    sudo /etc/init.d/instanceN stop
